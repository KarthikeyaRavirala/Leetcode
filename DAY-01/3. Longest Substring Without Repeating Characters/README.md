## Problem Statement

Given a string s, find the length of the longest 
substring without repeating characters.

## Topics
#### Hash Table
#### String
#### Sliding Window

### Example

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Constraints

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
