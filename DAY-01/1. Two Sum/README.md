# Two Sum

## Description

This repository contains a solution for the "Two Sum" problem on LeetCode. The problem involves finding two numbers in an array that add up to a given target. The solution is implemented in Python and utilizes the concepts of arrays and hash tables.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, the task is to return the indices of two numbers in the array such that they add up to the target. It is assumed that each input has exactly one solution, and the same element cannot be used twice.

### Example

#### Example 1:

```python
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, the function returns [0, 1].
