# Add Two Numbers

## Problem Statement

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. 
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


### Example

#### Example 1:
![image](https://github.com/KarthikeyaRavirala/Leetcode/assets/132122712/f62149af-eeaf-440a-8e72-51baf716fb8e)

```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

## Constraints

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
